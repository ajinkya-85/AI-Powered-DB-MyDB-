## Features

- **AI Query Generation**: Describe what you need in natural language, and the application generates the corresponding SQL query using Google Gemini (supports models like Gemini 2.5 Flash, Pro, and more).
- **Smart Database Scanning**: Automatically detects SQLite databases (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`) on your system or within specific folders.
- **Interactive Query Execution**: Execute generated queries safely and view results in a dynamic, scrollable grid.
- **Table Inspector**: Browse database schemas and view table contents instantly.
- **Data Export**: Export query results to CSV format for reporting or external analysis.
- **Modern Interface**: Built with CustomTkinter for a sleek look, featuring toggleable **Light** and **Dark** themes.
- **Secure Configuration**: Locally stores API keys and user preferences.
